## Objectives

One of our overarching objectives is to conceptualize what specific codes mean and how they are useful for data exploration, data visualization, and hypothesis testing. Our second objective is to explain what graphs and what specific statistical tests should be used for particular data. 

Specifically, Amma is going to be working with data exploration. She is going to explain and demonstrate how to understand the structure of data, summarize its characteristics, and find patterns/trends. She is also going to explain how to load data and check for missing data. 

Shihab is going to be explaining the section about data visualization. He is going to explain and demonstrate how to know which graphs to use based on the types of variables within the dataset, and how to make them visually understandable and aesthetically appealing.

Beth is going to focus on hypothesis testing. She is going to explain and demonstrate when to use which statistical tests depending on the data. She is also going to show how to conduct these tests and interpret them, and how linear models can be utilized during hypothesis testing.
